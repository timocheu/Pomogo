# Pomogo
A pomodoro cli-app made in **Go**. I'm tired of using pomodoro web-app because it needs internet connection. I built pomogo for offline scenario.

# Installation âš¡
Get, [download](https://go.dev/) and install **Go**. Version `1.24` or higher is required.

Clone the repo and build the source file using `make`
```
git clone https://github.com/timocheu/Pomogo.git
cd Pomogo
make
```
